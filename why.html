		<h1>WHY SERIOUS?</h1>
        <p>Under the influence of traditional Confucian culture, man is presented first as a member of the family rather than as a person in his own right. That is, in China, privacy is more collective. This is essentially different from the starting point of privacy in the West. Moreover, the state is considered to be an extension of the home, so we are not so resistant to "surrendering privacy to managers". This is my reflection as a Chinese, and I hope that in some way I can tell you. There is no right or wrong culture, and there is no right or wrong culture of privacy, but people should know what kind of environment they are in, and what kind of mode they are thinking in.</p>
        <p>在传统儒家文化的影响下，人被首先表现为家的一员，而非他本身。也就是说，在中国，隐私是更加集体化的。这在本质上和西方隐私的出发点不同。而国家有被认为是家的延伸，因此我们对“向管理者交出隐私”这件事并没有如此抵触。这是我作为一个中国人的反思，也希望通过某种方式能告诉大家。文化并无对错，隐私文化也没有对错，但人应该清楚的知道自己处于什么样的环境，和自己在以何种模式思考。</p>
